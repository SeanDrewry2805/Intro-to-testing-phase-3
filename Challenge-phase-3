Could you list the same space with a different name - trying to overlap spaces
Person who listed the space didn’t enter the correct date info - listing space would be impossible if info is wrong
Property damage/Issues with location.
User books two spaces for one night (limitation to amount of spaces?)
Personal data theft (are the details stored securely? Such as bank info or passwords)

Assumptions/questions

User can create an account: account page
Only one night for a request?
Spaces will be looked after by buyers
Stripe is a secure way of paying for spaces
Buttons are all linked correctly
Pages all render within an acceptable time
Basic error messages are hard coded e.g. (Password doesn’t match, please try again)

Possible testing scenarios:

Sign up/login:
- Testing input fields for extreme cases or unusual inputs
- Testing against previously stored info (trying to create an account that already exists)
- Malicious inputs (SQL breaches)

Listing a space:
- Testing input fields for extreme cases or unusual inputs
- Testing date field(s)
- Testing repeated listings 

Hire a space:
- Testing Search fields for extreme cases or unusual inputs
- Hiring a space that has already been booked (see if error message or user message appears)
- Testing if dates match up to applicable spaces
- Testing that unconfirmed spaces do not stop other users from booking

Approving/viewing requests:
- Checking if booked spaces match up to requests page 
- Checking if info on requests made/received match with booking info
- Testing that a request can be approved/denied
- Approval is received by the person booking 
- Checking that the date for that space has been greyed out/removed from selection

Important testing scenarios/ initial priorities:

- Sign up and log in
- Security and reliability
- Booking a space
- Approving or viewing requests
- Checking website for updates after the previous actions (greyed out dates that have been booked) (User experience more related to logged in user)
